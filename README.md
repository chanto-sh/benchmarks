# Chanto benchmarks

Benchmarks for [Chanto](https://github.com/chanto-sh/chanto): coding tasks with
automated checks, a runner that drives Chanto and other coding agents on the
same model, and every raw result behind the published numbers.

- [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md): results, with the versions and files behind each table
- [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md): what a run records and how to check a result yourself

## Run it

Clone this next to a Chanto checkout and build Chanto. The runner uses
`../chanto/target/release/chanto` (set `CHANTO_REPO` or `BENCH_CHANTO_BIN` to
point elsewhere). The runner itself needs only Python 3; `install-agents.sh`
installs the agents it compares at pinned versions (with npm, uv and
checksum-verified downloads) into `~/.local/share/chanto-bench`, which runs use
before anything on your PATH.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chanto-sh/chanto.git
git clone https://github.com/chanto-sh/benchmarks.git chanto-benchmarks
(cd chanto && cargo build --release)
cd chanto-benchmarks
./install-agents.sh      # the other agents, at the versions RESULTS.md reports

# A local model through Ollama
python3 run.py --agents chanto,opencode,claude --model qwen3.8-bench

# Or a hosted model through the proxy (start it in another terminal)
./proxy.sh deepseek/deepseek-flash
python3 run.py --api http://localhost:4000 --agents chanto,opencode,claude,codex --tier hard
```

`--tasks` picks tasks by name or glob, `--tier` by tier, and `--estimate` prints
the expected tokens, cost and time without running anything. `--offline` runs
each agent in a sandbox that hides this repository, the Chanto sources and
package caches, so agents can't read hidden tests or earlier runs
([docs/sandbox.md](docs/sandbox.md)).

`python3 -m unittest -v test_run` tests the runner itself.

## Tasks

Each task is a folder in `tasks/` with a prompt, starting files and a
`check.sh` that decides pass or fail. Tasks are grouped into tiers by name:

| Tier | Tasks | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| core | `poly-*`, `humaneval-*`, `mbpp-*`, `trap-*` | Small exercises in several languages |
| medium | `ds1000-*` and hand-written tasks | Bug fixes, features, refactors, test writing |
| hard | `swe-*` | Real GitHub issues from SWE-bench Lite and Verified |
| beyond | `coding-*`, `math-*`, `physics-*`, `trap-imp-*` | Work that can't be faked: hidden inputs, impossible requests |
| showcase (opt-in) | `data-*`, `analysis-*`, `nontrad-*`, `finqa-*` | Answers rather than code; scored separately |

A run covers the four coding tiers unless `--tier` says otherwise.
[docs/tasks.md](docs/tasks.md) has the task format and the tiers in detail, and
[docs/importing.md](docs/importing.md) covers the public datasets (SWE-bench,
EvalPlus, DS-1000, FinQA, Aider's polyglot set).
